This file contains a low resolution version of the HumVee military
vehicle. The model data is in Wavefront .obj format. Included is the
geometry, the material descriptions, a uuencoded jpeg of the camo
texture, and a uuencoded jpeg of the thumbnail picture.

This HumVee model was produced by Louis Batayte (lbatayt@nswc.navy.mil)
using the Wavefront package Advanced Visualizer.

The model contains 220 polygons, 320 vertices, which are in 41
triangles, 167 quads and 12 Ngons. None of the polys are concave. The
largest non-planarity angle of any polygon is 1.5 degrees.  The model
also contains appropriate texture and vertex normal vectors, along with
the smoothing group information.  The Advanced Visualizer "Check
Database" function reports "no errors"

The dimension units are in meters. Dimensional data is not exact.

This file was successfully tested by transfering it in ascii mode to a
Macintosh, breaking out the uuencoded sections, decoding them with
stuffit expander, and displaying the resulting jpegs
